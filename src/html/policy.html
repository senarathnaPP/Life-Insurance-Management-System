<h1>Terms & Conditions of Safe Guard Insurance </h1></div>

<br>

<div class="holdingcontainer">
    <div class="internalcontainerL">
	<h1><b>Policy terms and conditions</h1></b>
	<br>
	These policy terms and conditions describe your policy, including:
    <ul>
	  <li>our obligations to you</li>
	  <li>your cover</li>
	  <li>claims conditions</li>
	  <li>your obligations to us</li>
    </ul>
	These policy terms and conditions provide you with everything you need to know
about your Life Insurance policy. It is important that you read them carefully along with
your policy schedule.
If a claim is to be made, these policy terms and conditions will be useful, so please keep them
somewhere safe.
Should you have any questions or queries about your policy then call us on +94112224709 
and we will be pleased to help you.
You will see some words shown in bold type which are defined terms and have specific meanings
when used in this document. The meanings of these words are shown in the definitions section at the
front.
We will always act fairly, in good faith and in a reasonable manner towards you when dealing with
your policy and when applying these policy terms and conditions. We encourage you to tell us
whenever you feel we have not done so. This commitment is an overriding principle and you should
read each of the sections in these policy terms and conditions in light of this commitment.
Life Insurance is provided by Safe Guard and brought to you in association with Santander, who sell Safe Guard
life insurance products, which include the Life Insurance policy.
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Policy options</b></h2>
<br>
The following options can be included in your policy, subject to
underwriting. Each additional option you choose will increase your
total premium. If these options are included in your policy, the optional
benefits section of your policy schedule will confirm this.<br>
<u>Indexation option</u><br>
If you have chosen the indexation option, we will review the benefits at
the anniversary date in line with the Retail Prices Index calculated 12
weeks before the anniversary date.
If you have chosen level cover, then following the review your sum
insured will increase in line with the increase in the Retail Prices
Index over the 12 month period to the review date. Your premium
will increase based on a rate of 1.4 times the percentage increase in
the Retail Prices Index. The premium will not increase by more than
14% and will not reduce in the event of the Retail Prices Index being
negative.
If you have chosen family decreasing cover then following the review
your sum insured will increase in line with the increase in the Retail
Prices Index over the 12 month period to the review date, but your
premium will remain the same.
When we review the benefits:
n If the Retail Prices Index increase is greater than 0% and is 10% or
less, indexation will be applied to the benefits.
n If the Retail Prices Index is over 10% we will only increase the
benefits up to a maximum of 10%.
n If the Retail Prices Index is negative there will be no reduction to
the benefits.
We will advise you of any change to the benefits, and premium for
level cover, 8 weeks before the anniversary date. If you have level
cover, if we do not receive confirmation from you that indexation is
not required then the change will be applied on the anniversary date.
If you wish to cancel indexation before the increase takes effect then
you will need to contact us before the anniversary date. If you do not
contact us before the anniversary date we will still permit you to cancel
indexation up to 30 days after the anniversary date and if necessary we
will either refund the increase in premium or adjust future collections.
If you have family decreasing cover then it will not be possible to cancel
or remove indexation from your policy.
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Policy flexibility</h2></b>
<br>
Once we have started cover under your policy, you can request that
certain changes be made to it.
The following amendments will result in us amending your existing
policy and will not require any further underwriting.
<ul>
 <li>Decreasing the sum insured.</li>
 <li> Decreasing the policy term.</li>
 <li> Removing the indexation option on level cover.</li>
 <li> Removing the waiver of premium option.</li>
</ul> 
You may request these changes be made to your policy with effect
from the date that the next premium is due. Where we are asked to
remove an option we will simply deduct the charge for that option from
the premium. For all other changes we will use the premium rates and
age applicable at the time that we make the change. Your premiums
following the change cannot be less than the minimum premium of
Rs.1400 per month. These policy terms and conditions will continue to
apply.
The following amendments will require your existing policy to be
cancelled and be replaced by a new policy and may require further
underwriting:
<ul>
 <li>Increasing the policy term.</li>
 <li>Changing from level cover to decreasing cover.</li>
 <li>Changing from decreasing cover to level cover.</li>
 <li>Adding a life insured.</li>
 <li>Removing a life insured.</li>
</ul>
You may request these changes be made to your policy with effect
from the date that the next premium is due. We will use the premium
rates and age applicable at the time that we make the change. New
policy terms and conditions applicable at that time will be issued in
place of these policy terms and conditions
